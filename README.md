# Favorite Recipes Project

This is the first project in my **Odin Web Development Journey**.

It's a simple HTML project that showcases recipes for my all-time favorite foods. Initially, the project was built using just HTML. As the lessons progressed, I enhanced it by applying **CSS styling** to improve the layout and appearance.
