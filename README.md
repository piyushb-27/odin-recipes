This is the first project im working on during my odin web dev journey.

Its a simple HTML project which would be displaying recipe of my favourite foods of all time! For right now, it consists of only HTML but as we progress in this project, we will come back to it later to add styles to it using CSS.

For this project, following skills are required:-
- Basic structure of HTML
- Elements and tags
- Text formatting
- Image insertion
- Using Lists
- Committing messages in a proper format
